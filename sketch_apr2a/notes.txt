Arduino 1 Notes:
[ 0.25 - inch side ]

1 servo for hopper gate (6 volts)
    - opens at start of machine and stays open
1 motor for Archimedes screw (12 volts)
2 solenoids (12 volts)
1 color sensor (5 volts)
[1 inductive proximity sensor]
2 trap door servos (6 volts)
    - steel
    - brass
3 chute gate servos (6 volts)
    - steel
    - brass
    - nylon
3 limit switchs, when one is not depressed, this Arduino's program pauses (5 volts)

(1 motor, 2 solenoids, 6 servos, 3 limit switches total)
3 connections to relay board - 1 motor, 2 solenoids
5 for PWM - 3 big servos, 1 for small servos together, 1 for color sensor output
10 for digital - 3 for relays, 4 for color sensor, 3 for limit switches
